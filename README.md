# Estimating risk to pedestrians at signalized intersections
Implementation of the PSI model that estimates the number of potential conflicts and the severity of outcomes can using traffic engineering fundamentals and knowledge of the intersection characteristics (ie. geometry, signal timing plan, and turning movement volumes). 

Completed Tasks:
- Computes potential conflict volumes

To Do:
- Computes probability of pedestrain being present in the crossing
- Computes conflicting speeds in the crossing areas
- Computes the probability of a crash being fatal in the crossing areas
- Computes the probability of a crash being severe injury in each area a,b,c,d
- Computes the pedestrian risk index for the crossing
